# Data Fishing


The project looks to create subjective or cultural “mappings” of the Slovenian and/or United Arab Emirates coasts and their respective port cities of Koper and Abu Dhabi. These mappings would place focus on the lives and experiences of the people who are a part of fishing industries and communities.

A map in this sense may not or may not resemble a typical spatially defined map. The goal is to explore the boundary of the sea(s) through the people and their technologies most directly connected to it(them).

(Unquantifiable data could be fishermen’s superstitions and their own “gut” feeling of the weather and when it is a good time to fish, which time of the year brings them a better catch)

# Interview/Survey:

What is your favourite time in a year (spring, summer, fall, winter) for fishing?
How do you personally predict weather or do you believe in weather prognostics?
How much does moon phases influence the catch?
How much has the arbitrage convention changed your relationship with fishermen in the bordering countries or how much did it change your work?

# The Data

The data would ideally come from four primary sources, listed in order of expected importance. 
A series of surveys or ethnographic interviews with fishermen or fish mongers. To gain perspective about time cultures, social norms, and historic overview.
A black-box like device which would be placed on boats and ships that records strictly quantitative technical information. Such as, but not limited to GPS location, Time, and weather metrics.
Economic data in the form of volume of sales, purchase of equipment or technology, and amount of exported/imported goods.
Existing maritime GPS tracking systems.

# Reasoning

Despite their historical importance and cosmopolitan cultures, coastal cities and communities are usually defined by their relation to the nearest primary political hub or capital city. Additionally, modern data collection is most commonly done from a strictly scientific and global perspective that for consumer, logistical, and technical reasons frequently leaves out coastal and oceanic regions and peoples. This creates a flattened perspective of the people and practices which interact and intersect with our oceans and risks ignoring or erasing traditional or common wisdom about our environment, economies, and societies.

# The Ethical

Technical data could be considered sensitive such as locations of “good fishing spots” ; these locations could be trade secrets or provide identifying personnel or vessel information to otherwise anonymous markets. Black box technical data is extractive.

Ethnographic style personal stories, or surveys would likely need to be done in native languages and developed with the members of the target communities in a way that was symbiotic. To ensure the most accurate translation language and worldview was achieved and to avoid mapping our bias and expectations and passing them on to potential audiences.

Economic data is statistical, the nature of statistics is that it averages out large data sets on one hand and is susceptible to so-called law of small numbers on the other. Care would need to be taken, to make sure any data collected was placed in its proper context to avoid disruption to markets.  

There is an on-going conversation around the legality of fishing in the high-seas or in contested waters. There may be special considerations regarding the sensitive natural of the political relationships to consider.
